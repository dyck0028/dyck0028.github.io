                <p>
                    Born and raised in Ottawa ON. Canada, I am an aspiring Game Developer/Designer with an educational background in English writing, Philosophy, and Legal Studies. As a writer and creative content creator, I firmly believe that the rise of artificial intelligence and artificial content will quickly create a greater demand for human creativity in content creation and narrative writing. I have 3D-modeled games, as seen on my personal portfolio, and am competent in C#, Unity Development, and am currently learning web development and HTML coding. My portfolio website can be found <a href="https://calvindyck.myportfolio.com" target="_blank">Here</a>.

                    My true passion and end-goal is to work as a writer or narrative designer for interactive media. Whenever I doubt my creative capabilities or the purpose of my creations/writing I am inspired by the words of essayist James Baldwin, &quot;One writes out of one thing only—one's own experience. Everything depends on how relentlessly one forces from this experience the last drop, sweet or bitter, it can possibly give. This is the only real concern of the artist, to recreate out of the disorder of life that order which is art.&quot; — James Baldwin, <b>Notes of a Native Son</b>.
